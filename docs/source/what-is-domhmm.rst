What Is DomHMM
=========================================================

DomHMM is a Python project written on top of the `MDAnalysis`_ library and shared as an `MDAKit`_.

It is used for automatically determining ordered or disordered lipid domains in bilayer membrane molecular simulations by using the Gaussian-based Hidden Markov Model, Getis-Ord autocorrelation statistics, and hierarchical clustering.

DomHMM is an open-source library. Please refer to any bugs, suggestions, and questions via the `issues`_ page of the repository.
