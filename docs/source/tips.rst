Tips for Usage
================

This page contains useful tips that will improve your experience of DomHMM

* Computation Time

.. note::
    In our tests, a Martini molecular dynamics simulation with 2000 frames with 720 lipids took around 25 to 30 minutes.

.. note::
    Sometimes Hidden Markov model training may stuck which is out of our control. If your program is taking long time with comparing to reference, you may consider restart it and enable `verbose` option.

* Post Analysis

.. note::
    TODO

* Community Support

.. note::
